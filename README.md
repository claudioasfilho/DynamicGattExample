# DynamicGattExample

This example shows how to add a dynamic Gatt database to an empty example.

I have added the Dynamic Gatt component and disabled the existing Static Gatt Database.

I have also added app_gattdb.c/h, which is where all the services and Characteristics are defined.

This was tested with SDK 3.2.x, GCC GNU Compiler v10.2.1 and the EFR32MG21A010F1024
